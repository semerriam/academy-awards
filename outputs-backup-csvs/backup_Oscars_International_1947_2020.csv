But for my first visit in Hollywood I feel I'm doing fine. And I want to tell you something who may for myself is very important. Hollywood, it's a town at the beginning of comedy, slapstick, pantomime. I'm, I will remember all the names from Mack Sennett to Chaplin to everyone. I'm still making pantomime in my little corner myself. Tonight, I know that if in Hollywood they have not done so many funny pictures, I would not be here tonight.

Several years ago I stood here in front of you to accept the award for ""The Sky Above--the Mud Below.""  It was that very Oscar which marked the beginning of the global acceptance of that film which was produced against the advice of many.  ""The Garden of Finzi Continis"" was made by Vittorio De Sica, Gianni Hecht Lucari and myself against similar advice.  We were warned that a film without any sex and without any violence, dealing in a subtle manner with a tragic chapter of mankind is a doomed venture.  Tonight, again, the Academy has given hope and inspiration to independent film producers everywhere to go ahead with their projects as long as they sincerely believe in them.  On behalf of all connected with ""The Garden of Finzi Continis,"" and also on behalf of those independent film producers out there, I humbly thank you.<br/>

I feel a little bit like Harry Truman when he was holding up the newspaper saying that Dewey had won the election.  Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I was privileged twice before to receive this award for ""The Garden of the Finzi-Continis"" and for ""Sky Above, Mud Below.""  Ironically, all three films have in common that they were made against well-meant advice and that they were made without any commercial concessions or considerations whatsoever.  I believe it is a tribute to the Academy that it has chosen ""Black and White in Color,"" a film entirely made in remote West Africa, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, a man who had never directed a feature film before, and played by a cast of excellent actors, albeit unknown.  I would like to say that it is this kind of recognition and of encouragement which keeps our industry fresh and alive and ever creative.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.<br/>

I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my crew in Iran, my producer Alexandre Mallet-Guy, Cohen Media, Amazon and my fellow nominees in the foreign film category. I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others, an empathy which we need today more than ever.<br/>

Samuel Goldwyn, Bart Walker, all of you, Christina Bazdekis, Jessica Sykes, Bumble. You're all there.

I mean, pretty uphills in my perspective. Those four white men being Magnus Millang, Lars Ranthe, Thomas Bo Larsen, my old friend – the whole cast, you were brilliant. Susse, Maria, all of you, took out your hearts for this and were brilliant. I want to send a special thank, of course, to Mads Mikkelsen, [exclaims!], Mads Mikkelsen. Yeah, give him a hand. Mads, you gave us your finest. Not just for the film, but for my daughter as well. And I'll never forget.<br/>

Okay, so we wanted to make a film that celebrates life, and four days into shooting the impossible happens. An accident on a highway took my daughter away. Someone looking into his cell phone. And we miss her and I love her. And… sorry. Two months before we shot this movie and two months before she died, she was in Africa. She sent me a letter. And she'd just read the script and she was glowing with excitement. She loved this. And she felt seen by this. And she was supposed to be in this. And if anyone dares to believe that she's here with us somehow, she – you'll be able to see her clapping and cheering with us. We ended up making this movie for her, as her monument. So, Ida, this is a miracle that just happened. And you're a part of this miracle. Maybe you've been pulling some strings somewhere, I don't know, but this one is for you. Thank you very much.<br/>
